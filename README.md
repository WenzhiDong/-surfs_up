# SurfsUp_Challenge

## Overview
I will open a surf n' Shake Shop serving surf boards and ice cream to local in Hawaii. My investor, W.Avy, concerns about the weather and wants me to do some analytics on it. 
I will Sqlalchemy module in Python to query the data From a SQLite database to find the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, 
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

 - The average temperature in June is a little higher
 - The temperature variation in June is smaller, because standard deviation is lower  
 - The minimum and maximum temperature in June are both higher than those in December
